# AWS-CDK-Typescript-Project.
This is an inspired masterclass project by Alex Dan, designed to follow up on a project after achieving the CCP certification.
I plan to get the AWS DevOps Engineer and certified developer in the near future.


## Primary goals.
By the end of this project, I should have achieved the following success criteria:
1) Write infrastructure as code with AWS Cloud Development Kit - CDK
2) Handle multiple CloudFormation stacks with CDK to reduce blast radius
3) Basic usage of CDK with constructs, outputs, and parameters
4) Build CI/CD pipelines with AWS CodePipeline for CDK
5) Serverless APIs with Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3
6) Intermediate CDK topics like intrinsic functions, aspects, cross-stack references
7) CDK code testing: declarative tests, matchers, captors, and snapshots
8) Multiple tenant apps with AWS Cognito and Amplify
9) Handle L1, L2, L3 CDK constructs
10) Basics and advanced topics of Typescript
11) Build a UI with React and Typescript
12) AWS IAM and CloudWatch
13) Make AWS SDK calls from anywhere
14) CDK best practices
